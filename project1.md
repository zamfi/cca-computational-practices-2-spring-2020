## Project 1

In our first project, you'll explore machine learning and get a sense for what modern techniques are capable of today.

The goals are:
- Learn about some of the crazy, creepy, and inspiring artistic potential of machine learning.
- Get familiar with some libraries for "Deep Learning".
- Develop comfort with running other people's code from the web that contains a lot of advanced stuff you may not understand.
- Time permitting, gain some experience in a non-JavaScript programming language.

### Week 1

In class, I introduced a [bunch of concepts and examples of things](machine-learning.pdf) that you can do with modern machine learning. In this first assignment, you'll explore some of those things.

Start by exploring [these p5.js sketches](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches) that use the ml5.js library for machine learning. Try a few of them out. Observe that they can be somewhat flaky and slow. Welcome to machine learning! (Please note: some of these only work in Chrome! Please use Chrome for this assignment.)

Make sure to try out the Style Transfer, YOLO, and PoseNet examples from the ml5.js examples above. Learn about what the [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org) library is capable of by visiting that link and reading through.

Next, I want you to make a change to the [YOLO - webcam](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/IE_P4q2m0LV) example -- make sure you "duplicate" the sketch into your account first:

**Assignment**: Modify the `draw()` function so that when a **person** is detected, the camera image goes blank and instead you only see the text **STOP LOOKING AT ME**. You should not need much more than an `if` statement -- but you will need to find where the category, or "class name", can be found, so that you can compare it with `"person"` and derermine whether to blank the screen and display the text.

<!--
**Assignment**: Make another modification, based on another class of object that might be detected. Or, two of the same object? 

**Assignment**: Btw, what kinds of objects does the YOLO sketch detect, exactly? Where does that list come from? Do some research and answer the two previous questions.
-->

### Week 2

In class, we explored the [Posenet webcam](http://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/cO4CGs7nGpt) sketch and modified it to perform the same action as YOLO -- hiding the video and displaying text when a person is detected, and changing that text if two or more people are detected.

Then, we deconstructed and wrote code for the simplest possible Pong game: two paddles and a ball that bounces between them, using the `mouseY` variable to control, and then *merged* that code into the Posenet webcam sketch. 

<!-- **Assignment**: This week, for homework, further modify the YOLO example to use position information as an input. Take one of the [p5.js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) that relies on user input of some form -- mouse, keyboard, etc. -- and modify it to use the position of your body as that input instead. You'll need to do some merging of code, and I'd recommend you merge the example code into the YOLO code instead of the other way around.

This exercise might be on the tricky side -- feel free to work with others in the class and [email me](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu) a single assignment, but make sure to credit your partners in your submission.

Please reach out by email or on Slack if you're stuck!

### Week 3

In class, we went over the homework and discussed how one might implement PeoplePong (aka YOPO) using the [YOLO detector](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/K_R2cZsR8Wu) and person objects. In workshop, some of you experimented with other ML models like [PoseNet](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/K_R2cZsR8Wu) that tracks people in a scene and where their major mobile body parts are (eyes, ears, nose, torso, arms, legs, wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles).

For this week's **assignment**, I'd like you to complete your in-class group project of Pong using visual input of a human body. Use YOLO or PoseNet (or another model!) to track people and use that tracking data to control the paddles (and other stuff?) in-game. Upload your code to GitHub, and also publish your work through the p5js editor by emailing me a link to your project: click the **share** option in the p5.js web editor's File menu and [email me](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu) the "Edit" link as well as the GitHub link. (Make sure to note who contributed what in the `Readme.md` file.)

Make something your team is proud of -- it should be beautiful or artistically interesting in addition to being technically capable. I'm excited to see what you come up with!
